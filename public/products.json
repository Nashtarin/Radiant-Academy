I’m using them in my outdoor fixtures and don’t have to worry about CFL’s and their terrible cold weather performance, plus they look better and I don’t have to feel guilty about leaving them on all night.” Another notes the 'pretty elements in the bulb' and says the lower-intensity 25-watt equivalence was just right for their kitchen light fixture.",

All six of mine are installed in a ceiling track light situation and have consistent color of light, no noticeable variation. In addition to the quality of the light itself, another reason is that they generate significantly less heat than their halogen counterparts.",
