If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",

I have also found that people good at algorithms and data structures are often a better programmer than others.They tend to improve your programming skill and coding sense, and that’s the main reason I suggest all kinds of programmers, from junior to senior to spend some time revising, refreshing, and honing your data structure and algorithm skills.Most of us first heard about them in school and colleges but didn’t understand at that time. At least I can say that to me. I first heard about the array and linked list of my engineering college. That time I didn’t know what is the real use of an array and linked list because most of the questions we face were based on theoretical knowledge without any practical application.",

To get a bit more context on why this survey is important, read on….Node.js had a very successful first 10 years of Node.js and the project is working to make the next 10 years even better. As part of that we’ve kicked off the Next-10 effort to document what we think is important for that to happen. You can follow the ongoing work of that team in this repo: https://github.com/nodejs/next-10.Without a handy crystal ball, it turns out that it’s a lot harder than just diving in and discussing our favorite technologies to see what the keys to success are going to be. Are things like WebAssembly, Typescript, etc. important to the people who use Node.js? I guess we need to better understand/document who uses Node.js first.So far the team has spent most of its time laying the foundation on which we hope to base discussions around specific technologies.We started by documenting our understanding of the project’s technical values as these will help us balance different aspects when necessary: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/guides/technical-values.md. It’s not as simple as X overrides Y but instead highlight what key values need to be factored into decisions. For example, there was consensus that good developer experience has been a key part of the success of Node.js and that it’s important for future success that we maintain that.",

        "desc": "Hi meows! In this tutorial we’ll be discussing how fetch and axios works individually, learn how to fetch data from an HTTP server in a reactJS application using fetch / axios, why axios is preferred over fetch. We’ll also be highlighting the major differences between the both these API’s.Why do we need Fetch or Axios? One of the fundamental tasks of any web application is to communicate with servers through the HTTP protocol. This can be easily achieved using Fetch or Axios.It’s simple fetch / Axios are used to fetch the data from the API endpoint (i.e to make AJAX calls) asynchronously, so the developer can integrate it in their application.Fetch and Axios are very similar in functionality. Some developers prefer Axios over built-in APIs for its ease of use. However, Fetch API is perfectly capable of reproducing the key features of Axios.Now we’ll be discussing the workflows of fetch and axios separately to understand them better when we do an individual comparison analysis towards the end of the article.the fetch API provides a JS interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline such as requests and responses. its also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy and logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.The Fetch API provides a fetch() method defined on the window object. It also provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline (requests and responses).The fetch method has one mandatory argument- the URL of the resource to be fetched. This method returns a Promise that can be used to retrieve the response of the request.Fetch is supported in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera. However, it is not supported in IE 11. To make it work there, you have to include some polyfills like isomorphic-fetch.",

        "title": "Redux Toolkit — The cheat sheet for Redux development",
        "desc": "Managing the state and configuring the redux store with too much boilerplate code can be a huge challenge. Also it requires too many packages to be added for different purposes which is a common concern for the developers out there. Redux-Toolkit on the other hand solves these issues when it comes to redux development by speeding up the process.\n\nIt is always encouraged to use Redux Toolkit since it gives us a clean coding convention which makes the complex system more manageable and boosts the process. Also the package Redux-thunk is already installed inside of it which is a cherry on the top when it comes to work with API’s.\nIf you are a beginner in redux and want to learn the core concepts of it before stepping into redux toolkit I’d recommend you to go through the article I’ve published at devgenious below and come back to this blog to get started with redux toolkit.\n\nAlso dropping here this simple “Book Shelf” project from my github that I’m using as an example to demonstrate redux toolkit on this article so that you can check out the code as well as the folder setup whenever you want. There are separate branches on this project for core redux, redux-toolkit and redux-thunk so you can toggle them and learn their differences in a single project.\n\nSo let’s get started from installation process! With just one command we can install all the packages we need to get our hands dirty with Redux-toolkit. This will ease our pain and install everything that we need.\n\nNow that redux-toolkit is installed, we do not have to worry about creating actions, reducers etc. separately from scratch rather we just have to follow the toolkits coding conventions and give our input there. It’s that simple.\nSlice: While working on redux-toolkit instead of creating separate actions and reducers we will create a slice with createSlice function. A “slice” in redux-toolkit is a collection of actions and reducer’s logic wrapped up inside the same file for your app. We will create as many slices as we want inside of our slices folder.\nSay for example we are working with books, so books can have different actions and reducers so we will create a slice named after bookSlice and define the actions and reducers inside of it.\n\nHere we’ve created a bookSlice and given it a name and then stored it’s initialState property coming from our fakeData. (We will see how we can fetch data from our API with redux-thunk in the later part of this article. Just keeping it simple for now).\n\nAfter that we will be adding reducers:\nNow looking at this setup above you might be asking where our actions are? All we can see is a reducers, right? Fun part here is we can write the name of reducers as plural which seems like actions themselves. It actually performs the action and reducer in the same method. This is the significance of react-toolkit. It helps us write less code. We can write more reducers if needed.\nAnother cool thing about this reducer function is it let’s us mutate directly which wasn’t possible before. Thanks to the “Immer Library” installed inside of the redux-toolkit. That’s why instead of copying a state by ternary operator we can directly push an element to the array since it is mutable here. We couldn’t have done it before!\n\nI will cover Redux Persist and it’s core implementations on a separate blog. Big appreciation if you read till this snippet, if you find this useful and informative drop a clap! Thank you.\n",

        "title": "Optimize React Application Performance",
        "desc": "Today we will learn about Optimize React Application Performance in this tutorial.\n\nReact.Js is an open-source JavaScript UI library for building user interfaces. Nowadays React is the most popular for frontend design. It’s especially used to building single-page applications. You can create large applications in React that can transform data without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is fast, scalable, and simple. Literally, React has the ability to use several clever technics to minimize costly DOM operations required to update the UI. But for some large applications, you need to optimize your React application performance. There are several ways to speed up your React applications, let’s learn about them -\n\nImmutable Data Structures - Data immutability is an inflexible way of writing code. It has many benefits such as Zero side effects, Easier to track changes, Simpler to create, test and use.\nProduction Build - If you are experiencing performance problems in React assure that you are testing with the minified production build.\nDependency Optimization - It means removing the methods/functions that you never used in your application. It will optimize the bundle size.\nMemorize React Components - Use the useMemo() hook to memorize/store the expensive functions result to use when the same input occurs again.\nAnimations - There are many packages/libraries for Animations. So don’t use CSS Animations instead use those libraries or packages.\nAvoid using Index as key - Using the key as the index can show wrong data as it is being used to identify DOM elements.\nReact.PureComponent - React.PureComponent optimizes components by reducing wasted renders.\nVirtualize Long List - It’s a way to improve performance when rendering a long list of data.\nServer-Side Rendering - Server-side rendered applications have a better user experience because users receive viewable content faster than client-side rendered applications.\nLazy Loading - If you use numerous images in an application then you should use Lazy Loading to avoid rendering all of the images at once to improve the page load time.\nMultiple Chunk Files - If you split your large files into smaller files it will help the browser to catch less and reduce loading time.\nReselect in Redux - It’s a simple selector library for Redux, it’s used for building memorized selectors.\nUsing a CDN - CDN delivers static content more quickly and efficiently.\nWeb Worker - JavaScript is single-threaded. To prevent slowed/ blocked down, web workers run a script in background threads. We can create & run it parallel to the main thread without hampering the UI flow.\nuseCallback() - It’s same like useMemo() but useMemo() memorize the results and useCallback() memorize the function declarations.\nThere are many ways to optimize a react application. You have to know the core concepts about React after optimization. Optimization without measuring is almost premature, so you should measure performance first so that you can easily figure it out.\n\nThanks for reading this tutorial.\n\nPosted by Iftakher Hossen\nOriginal Post on https://dev.to/iftakher_hossen/optimize-react-application-performance-467d",
