    "desc": "There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",

    "desc": "I have tried a lot of online platforms these days, but all other seemed very little helpful for me lately. So i felt very dipressed and stopped doing these kind of online courses. Fortunately one day while i was browsing the internet this website surfaced up to me and for no intention i just clicked in it and found their courses and enrolled a free course than i said to myself completing that course, If their free course is this much knowledge rich how will be their paid servieces. And then i subscribed to their pro-plus plan and now i am a pro in problem solving in Hacker rank. I encourage everyone to do atleast the pro plan if not just do the free ones and build your skills.",

    "desc": "Hello guys, both Data Structures and Algorithms are one of the most essential topics for programmers and if you want to learn Data Structure and Algorithms in 2022 then you have come to the right place.The best thing about them is that they never get out-of-date, and any investment you made in terms of time and money will pay rich dividends for a long time. I have also found that people good at algorithms and data structures are often a better programmer than others.They tend to improve your programming skill and coding sense, and that’s the main reason I suggest all kinds of programmers, from junior to senior to spend some time revising, refreshing, and honing your data structure and algorithm skills.Most of us first heard about them in school and colleges but didn’t understand at that time. At least I can say that to me. I first heard about the array and linked list of my engineering college. That time I didn’t know what is the real use of an array and linked list because most of the questions we face were based on theoretical knowledge without any practical application.",
